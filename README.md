# The Game Development Club Game

The Game Development Club Game is a game where two players work together to solve puzzles. There is a platformer player that acts like a regular platformer, like Mario. The anti-gravity player that, as the name suggests, isn't affected by gravity. The catch? Once the anti-gravity player starts moving, it can't be stopped until it hits a wall.

The players work together to toggle levers and buttons to make platforms disappear and reappear so that they can make it to the end of the level.
